# Reading and Writing Books <br>
Project Description: <br>
This website aims to offer readers and writers seamless access to a vibrant 
online book community where they can engage in reading and writing, connect 
with fellow book lovers, and share ideas. Users will first identify themselves as 
either "Readers" or "Writers," each with distinct interfaces and functionalities. 
Readers can add books to their personal library, participate in book discussions, 
categorize their collections, and manage their books by editing or deleting 
entries. Writers, on the other hand, can publish their works, interact with readers 
through comments on their books, organize book events, and manage their 
published content by uploading, editing, or deleting their books.
